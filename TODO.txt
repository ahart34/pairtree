Think about "hard zeroes" in the method
  E.g., if we have the A -> B edge, we treat this case:
    A = 0.02 and B = 0.05, we trea
  the same as this case:
    A = 0 and B = 0.03
  If something has zero reads, we should treat that differently

Cleanup:
  Remove "dummy prob"
  Remove VAF corrections
  Remove all references to mu_v, replacing with omega_v
  Remove mu_r
  Think about new data format
    Should mutations have unique IDs?
    How to represent sample names? In a separate file?
    Store variant reads instead of ref reads
    Remove files not used by Pairtree

  Maybe remove empty first cluster?

Bugs:
  In phi_fitter's calc_mut_p, should I actually use 0.5? or omega_v?
    Since it's working on superclusters, this is probably okay
