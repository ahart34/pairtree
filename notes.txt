Canopy:
  MCMC chains are run serially, not in parallel
  No seeming means to provide omega_v -- it assumes diploid
  Given K leaves (corresponding to normal + (K-1) extant subclones), which is the same as K parameter used in Canopy API, you have (C = 2K - 3) edges on which mutation clusters can be placed
    I.e., your C edges lead to cancer (not normal) vertices
    Consequently, C must be odd -- if C is even, I suspect it will place one "empty" edge (not associated with a mutaiton cluster) at the bottom of the tree

PASTRI:
  I had to hack the source -- "is None" instead of "== None"
  The RunPASTRI.bash file is dumb
  /home/q/qmorris/jawinter/.apps/pastri/src/RunPASTRI.py
  Actually requires -o prefix:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/q/qmorris/jawinter/.apps/pastri/src/RunPASTRI.py", line 264, in <module>
        main()
      File "/home/q/qmorris/jawinter/.apps/pastri/src/RunPASTRI.py", line 246, in main
        with open(prefix+".trees", 'w') as out:
    TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'str'
