Think about "hard zeroes" in the method
  E.g., if we have the A -> B edge, we treat this case:
    A = 0.02 and B = 0.05, we trea
  the same as this case:
    A = 0 and B = 0.03
  If something has zero reads, we should treat that differently

Cleanup:
  Remove "dummy prob"
  Remove VAF corrections
  Remove all references to mu_v, replacing with omega_v
  Remove mu_r
  Think about new data format
    Should mutations have unique IDs?
    How to represent sample names? In a separate file?
    Store variant reads instead of ref reads
    Remove files not used by Pairtree

  Remove ability for phi fitter, tree samples, etc. to take clusters of variants -- they should just take single supervariant
  Remove .phi.json files, make JS extract freqs from tree summary
  Rejig the left/right node colouring in tree plotter -- make left/right samples user-configurable when plotting

Instead of just including garbage variants where *every* sample is drawn from uniform, have some garbage where only some samples are drawn from uniform
Change my grad desc to use Adam instead

Bugs:
  In phi_fitter's calc_mut_p, should I actually use 0.5? or omega_v?
    Since it's working on superclusters, this is probably okay


Steph:
  19 datasets
  14 patients
    +1 extra for SJBALL022610
    +4 extra for SJETV010
  PASTRI + SciClone:
    SciClone failed on four datasets
    Dropped variable numbers of variants on others
      cd ~/work/pairtree/scratch/results/steph.xeno.sciclone && for foo in *stdout; do echo $(echo $foo | cut -d. -f1) $(cat $foo | grep "of inadequate depth" | awk '{print $1/$4}'); done | sort -nk2
      | column -t
      Median: 17.4% of variants dropped
